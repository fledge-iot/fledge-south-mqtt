Message Payload
---------------

The content of the message payload published to the topic, to which the service is configured to subscribe, 
should be parsable to a JSON object, Integer, Float or String.

e.g. `'{"humidity": 93.29, "temp": 16.82}'`, `'100'`, `'90.9'`, `'STRING'`

.. code-block:: console

  $ mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "Room1/conditions" -m '{"humidity": 93.29, "temp": 16.82}'
  $ mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "Room1/conditions" -m '100'
  $ mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "Room1/conditions" -m '90.9'
  $ mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "Room1/conditions" -m 'STRING'
